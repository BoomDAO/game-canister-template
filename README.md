## WORLD TEMPLATE

The **World Template** is a ready-to-go template to launch your **World** canister smart contract manually and have it running on Day 1. A **World** serves as the command center, aka the "server backend" of your game, regulating the logic and rules governing your game economy. It connects to the **World Protocol** to store user data in a universal database.

You can download this World Template code if you would like to manually write your **World** yourself.

However, we recommend deploying a **World canister** on the [Game Launcher](launcher.boomdao.xyz) website. This way your World canister will get automatically upgraded with any new changes from BOOM DAO. From the Game Launcher website you can deploy/configure your World, download the [Unity Template](https://github.com/BoomDAO/unity-template) and edit it to call your World canister, and upload your Unity game client build to the website. Boom. You now have a fully on-chain game.
