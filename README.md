## WORLD TEMPLATE

The **World Template** is a ready-to-go template to launch your **World** canister smart contract manually and have it running on Day 1. A **World** serves as the command center, aka the "server backend" of your game, regulating the logic and rules governing your game economy. However, it's important to note that it doesn't store any data. It connects to the **World Engine** to store user data in a universal database.

You can download this World Template code if you would like to write your own custom logic for your **World** and deploy it yourself. You can write custom logic in the form of **Action Plugins** that enable you to add bespoke functionality to your World in a modular and reusable way.

If you don't need custom logic, you can easily deploy a vanilla **World** canister on the [Game Launcher](launcher.boomdao.xyz) website, configure your World's rules directly from the website, download the [Unity Template](https://github.com/BoomDAO/unity-template) and edit it to call your World canister, and upload your Unity game client build to the website. Boom. You now have a fully on-chain game.
